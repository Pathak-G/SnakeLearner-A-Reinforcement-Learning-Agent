🐍 SnakeLearner: A Reinforcement Learning Agent
SnakeLearner is an AI-powered Snake game agent built using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). This project showcases how an intelligent agent can learn to play the classic Snake game by interacting with its environment, optimizing its moves using reinforcement learning principles.

📈 Training Result: The agent showed improvement, progressing from 79 to 80 successful iterations, demonstrating its learning over time.

🚀 Overview
As part of my mini-project in Reinforcement Learning, I implemented a self-learning agent that:

Learns from experience (using short- and long-term memory)

Predicts Q-values using a Neural Network

Improves its performance over training episodes

The environment is built using Pygame, and the agent is trained using PyTorch.
